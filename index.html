                            <!-- ACM SIGSPATIAL has long served as a leading venue for geospatial computing algorithms.
                            As the field evolves, there is a growing recognition that the algorithms and systems should
                            go beyond abstract metrics and serve the values and goals of humans.  -->
                            <!-- Human-Centered Geospatial Computing addresses the critical intersection between advanced computing
                            techniques and the real-world needs, perceptions, and values of human users. It bridges the
                            gap between technical advancements and practical, people-oriented applications and fosters
                            interdisciplinary collaborations between spatial computing, human-computer Interaction
                            (HCI), human-centered AI (HAI), geoAI, human geography, and social sciences. Moreover, it
                            brings timely focus on the ethical concerns in geospatial technologies. Overall, the
                            GeoHCC’25 workshop complements the conference’s mission to advance both the
                            capabilities and the societal relevance of spatial computing.  -->
                            <!-- To further promote the
                            workshop’s themes and support continued engagement, we aim to encourage extended
                            versions of accepted papers to be submitted to relevant journals, such as IJGIS,
                            GeoInformatica, ACM Transactions on Spatial Algorithms and Systems (TSAS), and
                            Cartography and Geographic Information Science (CAGIS). -->
                            Rapid advances in geospatial computing technologies, including GeoAI, large-scale data
                            infrastructures, multimodal sensing, and large models, are reshaping how we model,
                            visualize, and engage with geographic phenomena. While these innovations are powerful,
                            the role of humans remains pivotal—they set the goals, implement and steer these
                            technologies, make critical decisions, and are themselves the very subjects these systems
                            are designed to serve. </br></br>
                            Human-Centered Geospatial Computing seeks to ensure that such technologies align with
                            human needs and values as well as amplify and augment human abilities while preserving
                            their control in order to make the system more productive, enjoyable, and fair. Specifically, it
                            focuses on fostering interactive collaboration through human feedback, boosting human
                            abilities in spatial reasoning, creative expression, and decision-making, and supporting a
                            deeper understanding of human experiences in space. At the same time, it demands careful
                            attention to ethical concerns, including privacy, bias, transparency, and trustworthiness, to
                            ensure that the developed system is both powerful and responsible.

                        The workshop seeks high-quality short papers of up to 4 pages (not including references) that have not been published in other academic outlets and are not concurrently under peer review. 
                        Once accepted, at least one author is required to register for the workshop and the ACM SIGSPATIAL conference, as well as attend the workshop to present the accepted work which will then appear in the ACM Digital Library. 
                        As GeoHCC papers appear in the ACM SIGSPATIAL proceedings we follow the same submission process. </br></br>

                        <strong>Paper Format</strong></br>
                        Accepted GeoHCC'25 papers will appear in the ACM SIGSPATIAL'25 Proceedings. Therefore, we follow the same formatting requirements as ACM SIGSPATIAL'25 which can be found at <a href="https://sigspatial2025.sigspatial.org/">https://sigspatial2025.sigspatial.org/</a>
                        Manuscripts should be submitted in PDF format and formatted using the ACM camera-ready templates available at <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template">https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template</a>
                        SIGSPATIAL uses the Conference Proceedings Primary Article template with two-column format. 
                        Alterations to the template, especially to gain more space, will be grounds for administrative rejection without further technical review. 
                        Submissions to ACM SIGSPATIAL are single-blind -- i.e., the names and affiliations of the authors should be listed in the submitted version. 
                        The author list is considered to be final after the submission deadline and no changes to the author list are allowed for accepted papers.</br></br>
